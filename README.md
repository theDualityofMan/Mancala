# Mancala

This program simulates a two-person game of mancala, using Java's swing library to creat a graphical user interface for the user to interact with.

## Description

Uses multiple classes in two packages - package mancala to handle data structures and game logic, and ui to handle the GUI. Each class uses OO design to create methods. 
To play a pit, click on it and the stones will distribute and the boarrd will update. There are options to enter player names and save and load both game states and user profiles.

### Dependencies

### Executing program
